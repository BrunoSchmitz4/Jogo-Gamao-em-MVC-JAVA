## About the Project

This project is an implementation of the classic board game **Backgammon** (known as *Gam√£o* in Portuguese), developed entirely in **Java** using the **Swing** library for the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The game is structured following the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern. This design ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase maintainable and scalable:
* **Model:** Contains the core game logic, including the rules, board state, and piece movement.
* **View:** Responsible for the visual presentation and user interface (the Java Swing components).
* **Controller:** Manages user interaction, processing events and updating both the Model and the View accordingly.

### Key Features

* Implementation of standard Backgammon rules (movement, hitting/capture, re-entry from the bar, and bearing off).
* Intuitive graphical interface built with **Java Swing**.
* Realistic simulation of rolling two dice.
* **Local Multiplayer** (Two-player game on the same computer).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **Graphical Interface:** Java Swing
* **Design Pattern:** MVC (Model-View-Controller)
